# MapReduce
Executable prototype of a MapReduce-like program.
Emulates the process of mapping input data to (key, value) pairs, combining pairs with identical key, and finally reducing those pairs to a smaller data set suitable for output.
This process if performed for three pre-determined tasks on the same dataset.
